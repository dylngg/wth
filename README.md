### What the hell was I working on (`wth`):

A dumb program that lets you record what you're doing by piping info into stdin. 
Records can be later run/viewed to see/do what you were working on. Input provided is put in it's own script in ~/wth. Stdin is not sanitized. This is intended such that the recorded bash commands can be run to restore windows and setup your previous work enviroment. Not secure (duh.), use with extreme caution.
